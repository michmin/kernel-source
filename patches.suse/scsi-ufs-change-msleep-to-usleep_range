Subject: scsi: ufs: change msleep to usleep_range
Git-commit: 838c1efc6a0adbf44d16e4714f43443db598cdb5
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1171622

This patch is to change msleep() to usleep_range() based on
Documentation/timers/timers-howto.txt. It suggests using usleep_range()
for small msec(1ms - 20ms) since msleep() will often sleep longer than
desired value.

After changing, booting time will be 5ms-10ms faster than before.  I
tested this change on two different platforms, one has 5ms faster, another
one is about 10ms. I think this is different on different platform.

Actually, from UFS host side, 1ms-5ms delay is already sufficient for its
initialization of the local UIC layer.
