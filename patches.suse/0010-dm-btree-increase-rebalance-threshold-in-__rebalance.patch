Subject: [PATCH] dm btree: increase rebalance threshold in __rebalance2()
Git-commit: 474e559567fa631dea8fb8407ab1b6090c903755
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc2
References: git fixes (block drivers)

We got the following warnings from thin_check during thin-pool setup:

  $ thin_check /dev/vdb
  examining superblock
  examining devices tree
    missing devices: [1, 84]
      too few entries in btree_node: 41, expected at least 42 (block 138, max_entries = 126)
  examining mapping tree

The phenomenon is the number of entries in one node of details_info tree is
less than (max_entries / 3). And it can be easily reproduced by the following
Procedures: 

  $ new a thin pool
  $ presume the max entries of details_info tree is 126
  $ new 127 thin devices (e.g. 1~127) to make the root node being full
    and then split
  $ remove the first 43 (e.g. 1~43) thin devices to make the children
    reblance repeatedly
  $ stop the thin pool
  $ thin_check

The root cause is that the B-tree removal procedure in __rebalance2()
doesn't guarantee the invariance: the minimal number of entries in
non-root node should be >= (max_entries / 3).

Simply fix the problem by increasing the rebalance threshold to
make sure the number of entries in each child will be greater
than or equal to (max_entries / 3 + 1), so no matter which
child is used for removal, the number will still be valid.
