Subject: [PATCH] fanotify: fix merging marks masks with FAN_ONDIR
Git-commit: 55bf882c7f13dda8bbe624040c6d5b4fbb812d16
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: bsc#1171679

Change the logic of FAN_ONDIR in two ways that are similar to the logic
of FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD, that was fixed in commit 54a307ba8d3c ("fanotify:
fix logic of events on child"):

1. The flag is meaningless in ignore mask
2. The flag refers only to events in the mask of the mark where it is set

This is what the fanotify_mark.2 man page says about FAN_ONDIR:
"Without this flag, only events for files are created."  It doesn't
say anything about setting this flag in ignore mask to stop getting
events on directories nor can I think of any setup where this capability
would be useful.

Currently, when marks masks are merged, the FAN_ONDIR flag set in one
mark affects the events that are set in another mark's mask and this
behavior causes unexpected results.  For example, a user adds a mark on a
directory with mask FAN_ATTRIB | FAN_ONDIR and a mount mark with mask
FAN_OPEN (without FAN_ONDIR).  An opendir() of that directory (which is
inside that mount) generates a FAN_OPEN event even though neither of the
marks requested to get open events on directories.
