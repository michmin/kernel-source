Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/64s: Save FSCR to init_task.thread.fscr after feature
 init

References: bsc#1065729
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
Git-commit: 912c0a7f2b5daa3cbb2bc10f303981e493de73bd

At boot the FSCR is initialised via one of two paths. On most systems
it's set to a hard coded value in __init_FSCR().

On newer skiboot systems we use the device tree CPU features binding,
where firmware can tell Linux what bits to set in FSCR (and HFSCR).

In both cases the value that's configured at boot is not propagated
into the init_task.thread.fscr value prior to the initial fork of init
(pid 1), which means the value is not used by any processes other than
swapper (the idle task).

For the __init_FSCR() case this is OK, because the value in
init_task.thread.fscr is initialised to something sensible. However it
does mean that the value set in __init_FSCR() is not used other than
for swapper, which is odd and confusing.

The bigger problem is for the device tree CPU features case it
prevents firmware from setting (or clearing) FSCR bits for use by user
space. This means all existing kernels can not have features
enabled/disabled by firmware if those features require
setting/clearing FSCR bits.

We can handle both cases by saving the FSCR value into
init_task.thread.fscr after we have initialised it at boot. This fixes
the bug for device tree CPU features, and will allow us to simplify
the initialisation for the __init_FSCR() case in a future patch.
